Pentest the target machine at 10.102.11.20 to extract the flag. The environment hosts a PHP web application (login.php) with a POST endpoint vulnerable to SQL injection in an UPDATE statement, enabling database manipulation to gain privileged access and retrieve the flag.

Steps:

    Network Scanning: Scan the target network to identify active hosts, focusing on 10.102.11.20.
    Service Enumeration: Enumerate services on 10.102.11.20 to confirm a web server on port 80.
    Web Application Testing: Inspect the login.php POST endpoint (e.g., username and password parameters) to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    SQL Injection Exploitation: Exploit the SQL injection in the UPDATE statement to either enumerate the database (e.g., users database, credential table) or manipulate records (e.g., set isAdmin=1) to access the flag.

Hint: Use curl to inspect login.php and test the POST endpoint. Then, use sqlmap to confirm SQL injection in the username parameter and enumerate the database structure (users database, credential table) to dump data. Alternatively, craft a targeted SQL injection payload in the username field (e.g., student';update credential set isAdmin=1;--) to modify user privileges, enabling access to the flag via session cookies. Manage cookies with curl to maintain session state after privilege escalation.

Pentest 10.102.11.20 to extract the flag via SQL injection in login.phpâ€™s POST endpoint (UPDATE statement).

Hint: Use sqlmap to confirm SQL injection, enumerate users database, and dump credential table (--dump) to get usernames and hashes. Craft a curl payload (e.g., ';UPDATE credential SET isAdmin=1;--) for the identified user, remember to use --cookie cookie.txt --cookie-jar cookie.txt and -L for session and redirects.


The objective is to Pentest a PHP web application hosted on 10.102.11.21 for file upload vulnerabilities that may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
